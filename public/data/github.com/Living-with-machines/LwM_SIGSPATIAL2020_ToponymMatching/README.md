## Installation

Please follow the instructions on [the installation section of DeezyMatch](https://github.com/Living-with-machines/DeezyMatch#installation) to set up a Python environment and install all the required packages to run [DeezyMatch](https://github.com/Living-with-machines/DeezyMatch).

Once working Python and DeezyMatch environments are available, the following additional libraries need to be installed:

```bash
pip install spacy
pip install geopy
pip install pandarallel
pip install python-Levenshtein
pip install pyxDamerauLevenshtein
pip install haversine
pip install mysql-connector-python
```

## Data directory and structure

In our code, we assume the following directory structure:

```bash
LwM_SIGSPATIAL2020_ToponymMatching/
├── datasets
│   ├── candidate_mentions_sets
│   ├── candidate_ranking_datasets
│   ├── gazetteers
│   ├── query_mentions_sets
│   └── toponym_matching_datasets
├── experiments
│   ├── inputs
│   │   ├── characters_v001.vocab
│   │   └── dataset-string-similarity_test.txt
│   ├── levdam_results
│   ├── mapped_results
│   ├── models
│   └── ranker_results
└── processing
    ├── candidate_ranking_datasets
    ├── candselection
    ├── gazetteers
    ├── toponym_matching_datasets
    └── resources
```

Description of main directories:
* `processing/`: contains code for preparing or generating the different datasets.
* `datasets/`: contains datasets used in the experiments, resulting from running the `processing/` codes.
* `experiments/`: contains the experiment codes and generated files.

The `experiments/` folder contains two notebooks with the [experiments](https://github.com/Living-with-machines/LwM_SIGSPATIAL2020_ToponymMatching/tree/master/experiments) reported in the paper:
* [Toponym_Matching_Experiments.ipynb](https://github.com/Living-with-machines/LwM_SIGSPATIAL2020_ToponymMatching/blob/master/experiments/Toponym_Matching_Experiments.ipynb) has the experiments summarized in table 1.
* [Candidate_Ranking_Experiments.ipynb](https://github.com/Living-with-machines/LwM_SIGSPATIAL2020_ToponymMatching/blob/master/experiments/Candidate_Ranking_Experiments.ipynb) has the experiments summarized in table 2.

(The results presented in this paper were generated by [DeezyMatch v1.2.0](https://github.com/Living-with-machines/DeezyMatch/releases/tag/v1.2.0) (Released: Sep 15, 2020).)

:warning: Make sure you have gone through the required `processing` steps (described [here](https://github.com/Living-with-machines/LwM_SIGSPATIAL2020_ToponymMatching/tree/master/processing)) and that you have all the data needed before you run the experiments.
