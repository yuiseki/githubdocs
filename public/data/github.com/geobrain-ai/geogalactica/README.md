## Statement
**To clarify with potential confusions, we hereby state that the model with the manuscript "GeoGalactica: A Scientific Large Language Model in Geoscience" is not associated with the DDE Program, nor supported by DDE related fundings. We feel sorry for the unintentional misunderstandings and inconvenience, and we commit to prevent future misunderstandings.**

## Introduction

GeoGalactica is from further pre-training of Galactica -- a top-performing LLM trained with a large number of scientific documents. In this work, we take the initial step to leverage LLM for science, through a rather straightforward approach. We try to specialize an open-sourced LLM into geoscience, by further pre-training the model with a vast amount of texts in geoscience, as well as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) the resulting model with our custom collected instruction tuning dataset. These efforts result in a model GeoGalactica consisting of 30 billion parameters. To our best knowledge, it is the largest language model for the geoscience domain.

## Quick Start

A simple script is provided (`tools/prediction/demo.py`) for the model to predict the output text for a single input. The memory exceeds 140GB.
The folder `example_data` shares data file format during the training.
