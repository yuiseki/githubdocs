## Capabilities

Geode is capable of answering geospatial queries that require complex reasoning and algorithmic computation. Here are a few examples of how Geode leverages its expert pool to answer geospatial queries.

🔍 **Query: Which one of the following countries is larger, Russia or Greenland?**

🪨 **Generated code**:
```python
def compute_answer(query: str):
    # Find the geographic locations and boundaries of Russia and Greenland
    russia_patch = patch_location_expert("Russia")
    greenland_patch = patch_location_expert("Greenland")

    # Calculate the areas of Russia and Greenland patches
    russia_area = sum(p.area for p in russia_patch.get_boundary())
    greenland_area = sum(p.area for p in greenland_patch.get_boundary())

    # Determine which country is larger
    if russia_area > greenland_area:
        answer = "Russia is larger than Greenland."
        patch = russia_patch
    elif russia_area < greenland_area:
        answer = "Greenland is larger than Russia."
        patch = greenland_patch
    else:
        answer = "Russia and Greenland are of equal size."
        # Return one of the patches for visualization, in this case, Russia
        patch = russia_patch

    return answer, patch 

result = compute_answer(query)
```

🔍 **Query: What is air quality like in the city that is known for the Eiffel tower?**

🪨 **Generated code**:
```python
def compute_answer(query: str):
    # Find the geographic location and boundary of the city known for the Eiffel Tower
    city_patch = patch_location_expert("Paris")
    
    # Retrieve air quality information for the entire city
    air_quality, air_quality_patch = air_quality_expert(city_patch, mode='point', parameter='us-epa-index')
    
    # Represent air quality as text
    air_quality_text = data_to_text_expert(air_quality)
    
    # Returning the textual answer and the GeoPatch object for visualization
    return f"The air quality in the city known for the Eiffel Tower is {air_quality_text}.", air_quality_patch

result = compute_answer(query)
```

🔍 **Query: Which state in the United states has the highest average humidity?**

🪨 **Generated code**:
```python
def compute_answer(query: str):
    # List of all state names in the United States
    state_names = [
        "Alabama", "Alaska", "Arizona", "Arkansas", "California", "Colorado", "Connecticut", "Delaware",

        "Rhode Island", "South Carolina", "South Dakota", "Tennessee", "Texas", "Utah", "Vermont",
        "Virginia", "Washington", "West Virginia", "Wisconsin", "Wyoming"
    ]

    # Initialize variables to store the maximum humidity and corresponding state patch
    max_humidity = 0
    max_humidity_state_patch = None

    # Iterate over each state to find the one with the highest humidity
    for state_name in state_names:
        # Finding the geographic location and boundary polygon of the state
        state_patch = patch_location_expert(state_name)

        # Retrieving humidity data for the entire state patch
        humidity_patch = humidity_expert(state_patch, mode='patch')

        # Checking if the current state has higher humidity than the previous maximum
        if state_max_humidity > max_humidity:
            max_humidity = state_max_humidity
            max_humidity_state_patch = state_patch

    # Elaborating the answer with computation steps
    answer = "The state in the United States with the highest humidity is not determined solely by the presence of a single maximum value. Humidity levels can vary significantly across different regions and time periods. An in-depth analysis considering spatial and temporal variations would be necessary to identify the state with consistently high humidity levels."

    # Returning the textual answer and the GeoPatch object for visualization
    return answer, max_humidity_state_patch

result = compute_answer(query) # make sure you call the compute_answer function at the end and store the output in a variable called result
```

🔍 **Query: If we were to mark Smyrna, Sandy Springs and Norcross as points on the map, would they form a triangle?**

🪨 **Generated code**:

    if len(set(locations)) < len(locations):
        return False

    # Check if the three points form a triangle using cross product
    x1, y1 = locations[0]
    x2, y2 = locations[1]
    x3, y3 = locations[2]

    cross_product = (x2 - x1) * (y3 - y1) - (y2 - y1) * (x3 - x1)

    # If cross product is not zero, points form a triangle
    return cross_product != 0

result = compute_answer(query)
```

🔍 **Query: Can you return an adjacency matrix representing the adjacency of state borders, for states in the US?**

🪨 **Generated code**:
