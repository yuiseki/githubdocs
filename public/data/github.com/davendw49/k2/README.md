## Introduction

We introduce **K2** (7B), an open-source language model trained by firstly further pretraining LLaMA on collected and cleaned geoscience literature, including geoscience open-access papers and Wikipedia pages, and secondly fine-tuning with knowledge-intensive instruction tuning data (GeoSignal). As for preliminary evaluation, we use GeoBench (consisting of NPEE and AP Test on Geology, Geography, and Environmental Science) as the benchmark. K2 outperforms the baselines on objectiv e and subjective tasks compared to several baseline models with similar parameters. 
In this repository, we will share the following code and data.

- We release K2 weights in two parts (one can add our delta to the original LLaMA weights and use `peft_model` with `transformers` to obtain the entire K2 model.)
    - Delta weights after further pretraining with the geoscience text corpus to comply with the LLaMA model license. 
    - Adapter model weights trained by PEFT (LoRA).
- We release the core data of GeoSignal that K2 used for the training.
- We release the GeoBench, the first-ever benchmark for the evaluation of the capability of LLMs in geoscience.
- We release the code of further pretrain and instruction tuning of K2.

***The following is the overview of training K2:***

## Quick Start

### Installation

**1. Prepare the code and the environment**

Clone our repository, create a Python environment, and activate it via the following command
```bash
git clone https://github.com/davendw49/k2.git
cd k2
conda env create -f k2.yaml
conda activate k2
```

**2. Prepare the pretrained K2 (GeoLLaMA)**

The current version of K2 is on Huggingface [Model](https://huggingface.co/daven3/k2-v1)
The previous version of K2 consists of two parts: a delta model (like Vicuna), an add-on weight towards LLaMA-7B, and an adapter model (trained via PEFT).

|Delta model|Adapter model|Full model|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
 [k2_fp_delta](https://huggingface.co/daven3/k2_fp_delta)|[k2_it_adapter](https://huggingface.co/daven3/k2_it_adapter)|[k2_v1](https://huggingface.co/daven3/k2-v1)|

- **Referring to the repo of Vicuna, we share the command of building up the pretrained weighted of K2**
```bash
python -m apply_delta --base /path/to/weights/of/llama --target /path/to/weights/of/geollama/ --delta daven3/k2_fp_delta
```

### Start with Docker
Coming soon...

**3. Use K2**
```python
base_model = /path/to/k2
tokenizer = LlamaTokenizer.from_pretrained(base_model)
model = LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    base_model,
    load_in_8bit=load_8bit,
    device_map=device_map
    torch_dtype=torch.float16
)
model.config.pad_token_id = tokenizer.pad_token_id = 0
model.config.bos_token_id = 1
model.config.eos_token_id = 2
```

Or, alternatively,

```python
base_model = /path/to/geollama
lora_weights = /path/to/adapter/model
tokenizer = LlamaTokenizer.from_pretrained(base_model)
model = LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    base_model,
    load_in_8bit=load_8bit,
    device_map=device_map
    torch_dtype=torch.float16
)
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(
    model,
    lora_weights,
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
    device_map=device_map,
)
model.config.pad_token_id = tokenizer.pad_token_id = 0
model.config.bos_token_id = 1
model.config.eos_token_id = 2
```

- **More detail are in `./generation/`**

## Data

In this repo, we share the instruction data and benchmark data:
- GeoSignal: `./data/geosignal/`
- GeoBench: `./data/geobench/`

### Further pretrain

Our text corpus for further pretraining on LLaMA-7B consists of 3.9 billion tokens from geoscience papers published in selected high-quality journals in earth science and mainly collected by [GAKG](https://gakg.acemap.info/).

### Instruction Tuning: GeoSignal

Scientific domain adaptation has two main steps during instruction tuning. 
- Instruction tuning with general instruction-tuning data. Here we use Alpaca-GPT4. 
- Instruction tuning with restructured domain knowledge, which we call expertise instruction tuning. For K2, we use knowledge-intensive instruction data, GeoSignal.

***The following is the illustration of the training domain-specific language model recipe:***

- **Adapter Model on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/): [daven3/k2_it_adapter](https://huggingface.co/daven3/k2_it_adapter)**
- **Dataset on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/): [geosignal](https://huggingface.co/datasets/daven3/geosignal)**

### Benchmark: GeoBench

In GeoBench, we collect 183 multiple-choice questions in NPEE,
and 1,395 in AP Test, for objective tasks. Meanwhile, we gather all 939 subjective questions in NPEE to be the subjective tasks set and use 50 to measure the baselines with human evaluation.

## Code

### Further Pretrain

The training script is **`run_clm.py`**

```bash
deepspeed --num_gpus=4 run_clm.py --deepspeed ds_config_zero.json >log 2>&1 &
```

![loss curve](https://www.cdeng.net/k2/loss_curve.png)

The parameters we use: 
```
- Batch size per device: 2
- Global batch size: 128 (2*4gpu*16gradient accumulation steps) 
- Number of trainable parameters: 6738415616 (7b)
- lr: 1e-5
- bf16: true
- tf32: true
- Warmup: 0.03/3 epoch (nearly 1000 steps)
- Zero_optimization_stage: 3
```

***Tips: We can not resume smoothly from checkpoints for the limited computing power. Therefore, we did not load the optimizer state dict when resuming training. Even though there are two noticeable spikes in the diagram, the performance seems to stay at normal.***

### Instruction tuning

The training script is **`finetune.py`**

- For the first step: is alignment with human
```bash
python finetune.py --base_model /path/to/checkpoint-30140 --data_path /path/to/alpaca.json --output_dir /path/to/stage/one/model/ --cuda_id 2 --lora_target_modules "q_proj" "k_proj" "v_proj"
```

- For the second step: alignment with expert
```bash
python finetune.py --base_model /path/to/checkpoint-30140 --data_path /path/to/geosignal.json --output_dir /path/to/stage/two/model/ --cuda_id 2 --lora_target_modules "q_proj" "k_proj" "v_proj" --resume_from_checkpoint /path/to/stage/one/model/
```

```
- batch_size: 128
- micro batch size: 4
- num epochs: 1
- learning rate: 3e-4
- cutoff len: 512
- val set size: 2000
- lora r: 8
- lora alpha: 16
- lora dropout: 0.05
- lora target modules: ["q_proj", "k_proj", "v_proj"]
```

- **Answer:**
    - **Question:** What is an IOCG?
    - **Answer:** Iron-oxide copper-gold (IOCG) deposits are a type of mineral deposit that are formed by the interaction of hydrothermal fluids with igneous rocks. They are characterized by high concentrations of iron oxide, coppermolybdenum, gold, and uranium minerals. Typically, they occur in the form of veins or breccia pipes, but they can also be found as disseminated ores in sedimentary and volcanic rock formations. The formation of these deposites is associated with the intrusion of magma into the Earth's crust, which causes the release of heat and pressure, leading to the separation of ore-forming elements from the surrounding rock. IO
- **Answer and Explain:**
    - **Question:** What is the most common igneous rock, and introduce it in detail.
    - **Answer:** Granite is a very common and widely distributed rock type. It is formed by the cooling and crystallization of magma that has been intruded into the Earth's crust. Granite has a coarse-grained texture and is composed of minerals such as quartz, feldspar and mica. The color of granite varies from light pink to dark gray, depending on the mineral composition and the amount of impurities present in the rock.
- **Answer with comparison:**
    - **Question:** What are the most economic nickel deposits?
    - **Answer:** Nickel sulfide ores are by far the world's most economically important source of the metal. They are typically found in ultramafic rocks, such as serpentinites, peridotites, and dunites. These rocks are formed by the partial melting of oceanic crust at mid-oceanic ridges. Nickel-copper-platinum-group-element (Ni-Cu-PGE) orebodies are often associated with mafic intrusions. The most famous deposit of this type is the Sudbury Igneous Complex in Ontario, Canada, which has been mined since the 1880s. Other examples include the

## Evaluation

We share the original evaluation code in [evaluation folder](https://github.com/davendw49/k2/tree/main/evaluation), and we will release **Geo-Eval** in the near future with more evaluation methods.

## Why named K2 ?

K2 is originally from the name of the second-highest mountain in the world, and we believe that in the future, larger and more powerful geoscience language models will be created. What is more, to train a model to shift to a discipline with a significant domain barrier, we have encountered many difficulties *(collecting corpus, clean academic data, computing power, ...)*, which shares with the fact that climbing K2 is no less challenging than Mount Everest üèîÔ∏è.
